        "question": "When Alice walks up the hill, her speed is 1 m/s and when she goes down the hill, her speed is 3 m/s. Then when Alice walks up and down the hill, what is her average speed?",
        "answer": ["1.5", "3/2"],
        "explanation": "If Alice covers a distance of d going up and down the hill, then her total distance is 2d. Her time going up the hill is d/1 = d, and her time going down the hill is d/3. So, her total time is d + d/3 = 4d/3. Therefore, her average speed is 2d/(4d/3) = 3/2 m/s.",
        "incorrect answer": ["2"],
        "incorrect explanation": "Alice's average speed can be calculated by adding her speed going up the hill and her speed going down the hill, and then dividing by 2. So, (1 m/s + 3 m/s) / 2 = 2 m/s. Therefore, Alice's average speed is 2 m/s."

        "answer": ["0.75", "75%", "3/4"],
        "explanation": "The first thing to realize is that Alice might not be out at all today, which happens 1 in 10 days. If she does go out (9/10 probability), she chooses each bar with 1/3 probability. Bob has already checked two bars, so if she is out, she must be at the third bar. So, the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob didn't find her at the first two is (9/10 * 1/3) / ((9/10 * 1/3) + (1/10 * 1)) = 3/4.",
        "incorrect answer": ["0.9", "90%", "9/10"],
        "incorrect explanation": "Alice goes to the bar every day with a probability of 9/10, and she is not in the first two bars, so if she goes to the bar today, she must be in the third bar."

        "question": "One peach costs one cent. You can use 3 peach pits to exchange for one peach. If you have 10 cents, then what is the maximal number of peaches you can eat?",
        "answer": ["15"],
        "explanation": "With 10 cents, you can initially buy 10 peaches. After eating these, you'll have 10 pits. You can exchange 9 of these pits for 3 more peaches. After eating these, you'll have 4 pits left (1 from before and 3 new ones). You can then exchange these for another peach. Now, you can eat 10 + 3 + 1 = 14 peaches. After eating these, you have 2 pits left (1 from before and 1 new pit). Because we are considering the number of peaches that are eaten the most. You can borrow one pit from others, and then exchange all the 3 pits for 1 more peach. After eating the last peach, you return the last pit. So in total, you can eat 10 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 15 peaches.",
        "incorrect answer": ["14"],
        "incorrect explanation": "With 10 cents, you can initially buy 10 peaches. After eating these, you'll have 10 pits. You can exchange these for 3 more peaches, and you have 1 pit left. Then, you eat these 3 peaches and have 4 pits. You can exchange these for another peach. So in total, you can eat 10 + 3 + 1 = 14 peaches. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that you can borrow 1 pit from others and therefore eat more peaches."

        "answer": ["48%", "0.48"],
        "explanation": "After drinking 20% of the milk, you have 80% milk left in the cup. When you fill it with water and drink 40% of the mix, you drink 40% of the 80% milk, leaving 60% of the 80% milk, which is 48% of the original volume. When you fill the cup with water again, the percentage of milk remains the same as the volume doubles, but the ratio of milk to total volume stays constant. So, there is 48% milk left in the cup.",
        "incorrect answer": ["68%", "0.68"],
        "incorrect explanation": "After drinking 20% of the milk, you have 80% milk left in the cup. When you fill it with water and drink 40% of the mix, you drink 40% of the 80% milk, which is 32% of the volume. When you fill the cup with water again, the percentage of milk is 100% - 32% = 68%."

        "answer": ["9.09%", "0.0909", "1/11"],
        "explanation": "The total weight of the mixture (salt + water) is 10 g + 100 g = 110 g. The percentage of salt is the mass of the salt divided by the total mass of the mixture, multiplied by 100. So, (10 g / 110 g) * 100 = 9.09%.",
        "incorrect answer": ["10%", "0.1", "1/10"],
        "incorrect explanation": "The salt is 10 g and the water is 100 g, so the salt is 10% of the water. This is incorrect because it mistakenly treats the water as the total mass, rather than the water plus the salt."

        "answer": ["0.5"],
        "explanation": "Initially, 10% of the apples is non-water content, which is 0.1 tons. After a few days, this non-water content makes up 20% of the total weight (because the water content has reduced to 80%). If 0.1 tons represents 20% of the total weight, the total weight of the apples now would be 0.1 tons / 20% = 0.5 tons.",
        "incorrect answer": ["0.9"],
        "incorrect explanation": "If the apples initially weighed 1 ton and 90% of that weight was water, then after the water content reduced to 80%, the weight of the apples would have reduced to 0.9 tons. This is incorrect because it mistakenly treats the weight reduction as linear, rather than considering the percentage of non-water content."

        "incorrect answer": ["13"],
        "incorrect explanation": "1 + 2 + ... + 14 = 105 > 100. So, you can sum 13 distinct natural numbers at most. This solution didn't take into account that 0 is also a natural number."

How many people are there at most?",
        "answer": ["47"],
        "explanation": "We have 20 math, 20 history, and 20 physics high-scorers, but some of these are counted multiple times because they scored high in more than one subject. Specifically, 7 people scored high in both math and physics, and 9 scored high in both history and physics. The people who scored high in both math and physics are counted twice in our total, as are the people who scored high in both history and physics. So, we subtract these from our total to avoid double-counting, giving us 20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - 9 = 44. Finally, we add the 3 people who did not score high in any subject, giving us a total of 47 people.",
        "incorrect answer": ["63"],
        "incorrect explanation": "You might think that you just add up all the people who scored high in each subject and those who did not score high in any subject, giving 20 (math) + 20 (history) + 20 (physics) + 3 (none) = 63.

There are two possibilities: either she saw a blue taxi and identified it correctly, or she saw a green taxi and misidentified it as blue.  The probability of seeing a blue taxi and identifying it correctly is (15% * 80%) = 12%. The probability of seeing a green taxi and misidentifying it as blue is (85% * 20%) = 17%. Therefore, the probability that the taxi seen by the witness is blue is (12% / (12% + 17%)) = 41%.",

        "question": "Suppose we find a murderer's fingerprint at a crime scene. After comparing this fingerprint with 20000 people, the police found a suspect whose fingerprint matches the one at the scene. Now, this suspect is brought to court and accused of being the murderer. The expert in court tells you that the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%. Assuming that all 20000 people compared by the police are innocent, what is the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with them one by one?",
        "answer": ["86.5%", "0.865"],
        "explanation": "The key here is that the police conducted 20000 independent fingerprint comparisons. Each comparison has a 0.01% chance of a misidentification. To calculate the probability of at least one misidentification, we first calculate the probability of no misidentification, and then subtract this probability from 1. Assuming each comparison is independent, the probability of no misidentification is the product of 99.99% raised to the power of 20000, i.e., (0.9999)^20000 \u2248 0.135. So, the probability of at least one misidentification is 1 - 0.135 = 0.865, or about 86.5%.",
        "incorrect answer": ["0.01%", "0.0001"],

        "question": "How many people need to be in a room to make the probability that at least two people have the same birthday exceed 50%?",
        "answer": ["23"],
        "explanation": "To understand this, you need to consider all possible pairs among people in the room, not just consider each new person entering the room pairing with the people already in the room. Therefore, when there are 23 people in a room, there are 253 possible pairs. The chance of these 23 people having different birthdays is: (364 / 365) ^ 253 = 0.4995. This is why it only takes 23 people to make the probability that at least two people have the same birthday exceed 50%.",
        "incorrect answer": ["183"],
        "incorrect explanation": "Many people's intuition would tell them that since there are 365 days in a year, it would take close to 365/2, or about 182 or 183 people, to make the probability that at least two people have the same birthday exceed 50%."

        "question": "In a city of 1 million inhabitants, there are 100 known criminals. All inhabitants, including the criminals, are tested with a new crime prediction technology. The technology has a reliability of 95%, meaning that 95% of true criminals are identified as criminals, and 95% of innocent people are identified as innocent. What is the percentage that a person identified as a criminal by the technology is indeed a criminal?",
        "answer": ["1.9%", "0.019"],
        "explanation": "Intuitively, one might think that if the technology identifies someone as a criminal, there would be a 95% chance that they are indeed a criminal, given the reliability of the technology. However, this is a misunderstanding of the concept of conditional probability. In this case, the actual probability is much lower. Among 1 million people, 100 are criminals. According to the reliability, the technology will correctly identify 95 criminals (95% of 100) and incorrectly identify 5% of the innocent people as criminals, which is 49950 people (5% of 999900). So, if a person is identified as a criminal, the probability that they are indeed a criminal is 95/(95 + 49950), which equals approximately 0.019, or 1.9%.",
        "incorrect answer": ["95%", "0.95"],
        "incorrect explanation": "It might seem intuitive that a person identified as a criminal by a technology with a 95% reliability would indeed be a criminal 95% of the time. However, this fails to take into account the number of false positives (innocent people incorrectly identified as criminals) generated by the technology. Given the vast number of innocent people compared to criminals, even a small percentage of false positives can greatly exceed the number of true positives (actual criminals correctly identified)."

        "question": "You have 100 chairs in a row. You start by flipping every chair (1, 2, 3, ..., 100) from its initial position. Then, you flip every second chair (2, 4, 6, ..., 100). Next, you flip every third chair (3, 6, 9, ..., 99). You continue this process until you flip every 100th chair (only chair 100). How many chairs are flipped back to their initial position after all the flips?",
        "answer": ["90"],
        "explanation": "A chair will be flipped back to its initial position if it has been flipped an even number of times. A chair will be flipped every time one of its divisors is encountered in the process. For example, chair 6 will be flipped during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th steps. Notice that divisors come in pairs, like (1, 6) and (2, 3) for chair 6. So, for most chairs, they will have an even number of divisors and will be flipped back to their initial position. However, square numbers have an odd number of divisors because one of the divisor pairs is a repeated number (e.g., chair 9 has divisors 1, 3, and 9). So, only square number chairs will not be flipped back to their initial position. There are 10 square numbers between 1 and 100 (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100), so there will be 100 - 10 = 90 chairs flipped back to their initial position.",
        "incorrect answer": ["50"],
        "incorrect explanation": "You might think that half of the chairs will be flipped back to their initial position since you are flipping every other chair in the process. This would give an answer of 100 / 2 = 50 chairs. However, this is incorrect because it does not take into account the number of divisors for each chair and the fact that square numbers have an odd number of divisors."

        "answer": ["55"],
        "explanation": "This problem involves exponential growth, but it is not as simple as it might seem. In the first month, you have 1 mouse. In the second month, that mouse produces 6 offspring, so you have 7 mice. In the third month, the original mouse produces another 6 offspring. However, the first 6 offspring cannot produce as they are only one month old. In the third month, we have 13 mice (1 2-month-old + 6 1-month-old + 6 newborns). In the fourth month, the original mouse produces another 6 offspring, the first 6 offspring each produce 6 more mice, resulting in 13 + 6 + 6*6 = 55 mice.",
        "incorrect answer": ["343"],
        "incorrect explanation": "One might think that the newborn mouse can produce 6 more mice in the second month, actually it's incorrect because they are only 1-month-old in the second month. Now we show the incorrect calculation process as follows. In the first month, you have 1 mouse. In the second month, that mouse produces 6 offspring, so you have 7 mice. In the third month, the original mouse produces another 6 offspring, the first 6 offspring each produce 6 more mice, resulting in 1 + 6 + 6 + 6*6 = 49 mice. In the fourth month, all the 49 mice each produce 6 more mice, resulting in 49 + 49*6 = 343 mice."
